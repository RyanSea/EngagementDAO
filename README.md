# ValuDAO
## What if we could design an ecnomic system native to the internet?
In our current system we're forced to treat value and monetezation as separate entities. In social media the value is the content, and the monetization is through ads and the sale of our personal data. This works well enough for the platform, but it's at the expense of the actual users. 

What if monetization was dictated by the will of the users rather than generated by extracting from them? What if money was generated based purely on what people find valuable?

## Tokenized Engagement
Online engagmenet is the measure of value proivded to users. Using DeFi primitives, it's possible to tokenize it â€” to turn it into money. This eliminates the need for monetization, because value itself becomes the monetization. This is the future of social media.

## How it works
Amanda makes a funny / informative post, and Ryan (who is staked) signifies that he finds it valuable with a Like. This Like generates yield based on Ryan's stake, and the yield is rewarded to Amanda (as an incentive to create more good content) and some is also rewarded to Ryan (as an incentive to stake).

To prevent spam, if Ryan comes across Devon's post immediately after giving Amanda a Like, and he Likes Devon's post, then *less yield* would be generated.
